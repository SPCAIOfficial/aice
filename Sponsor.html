<p>The Sino-Pak Center for Artificial Intelligence (SPCAI) is located at Pak-Austria Fachhochschule: Institute of Applied Sciences & Technology (PAF-IAST), Mang, Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. PAF-IAST is a public sector higher education institute enacted by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, having its campus in Mang – Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The SPCAI is a center of excellence in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is sponsored by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT) under the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). SPCAI is being executed, maintained, and operated by PAF-IAST. The overall objective of the SPCAI is to build national capacity to carry out Research and Development (R&D) in the emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) field.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">About Artificial Intelligence Conference and Expo, AICE 2024:</h4>
<p>Under the auspices of the MoITT, the SPCAI is planning to hold the Artificial Intelligence Conference and Expo (AICE) in Pakistan on May 27-29, 2024. The proposed conference, expo and forum aims to gather policymakers, regulators, practitioners, experts, innovators, end-users, investor groups, researchers, educators, entrepreneurs, interested public, and representatives from various industries from Pakistan and abroad under one roof to initiate a grand national discourse about the importance and effectiveness of AI in socioeconomic settings. 
    <br><br>The AICE is an effort to develop an awareness of the role and impact of AI in Pakistani society and industry, as well as industrial processes, social fabric, and economic growth. The AICE also aims to advance Pakistan’s AI ecosystem through connections, advocacy, growing talent, and collaboration. The AICE promotes the economic opportunities raised by AI, supporting great applications of AI and emerging AI firms. It ensures that society can adapt to the rapid and far- reaching changes that AI technology will bring. The event would comprise plenary sessions and formal proceedings where industrial and academic experts would share their valuable ideas, insights, and experiences. 
    <br><br> An expo would also be organized where representatives from industries and academia will showcase their AI-based projects, products, and solutions. In addition, world-renowned scientists and AI experts will address the forum. AICE provides an excellent networking opportunity with relevant stakeholders. AICE also offers a perfect platform to initiate discussion about a coherent national AI policy.
    </p>

    <h4 style="text-align: left;">Lab2Market</h4>
    <p>As a part of the AICE, SPCAI has also planned to organize a project expo as a “Lab2Market” event. The students from Pakistani universities will be invited to showcase their AI-based applied research ideas in the form of projects, prototypes, or artifacts. The projects may relate to the fields of computer vision, robotics, intelligent systems, IoT, smart agriculture, smart health, biomedical applications, and relevant areas. By organizing this project exhibition in concurrence with the AICE, SPCAI aims to provide a powerful platform for the students to interact with the experts from industry and academia (both local and foreign) and get their feedback regarding the project ideas. </p>
